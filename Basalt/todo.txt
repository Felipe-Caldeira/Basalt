Todo:

Important:

- Fix Textfield -> Inside a sub-sub frame the cursor vertical coordinates have wrong position (by 1)
- term_resize needs to update all frames, not just the mainframe
- Second label's width is for some reason wrong (smaller than text)
- Textfield needs addLine, removeLine..
- Program needs a stop and other stuff
- Image is not finished
- Flexbox has a bug when resizing the window multiple times (it starts to look wrong after 4-5x resizing)
- BigMonitor monitor_resize isn't finished
- Scrollbar isn't implemented yet

Low:

- Skip some render calls
- Better logging system
- Better debugging tools
